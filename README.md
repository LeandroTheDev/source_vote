# Source Vote

## Map Vote
Creates map vote system when coop/versus/survival/survivalversus ends

Also includes the commad ``!startvote`` for admins with the flag "g"

To disable add ``-disableMapVote`` to command line parameters

### How it works
- After the end of the round (survival) or map (coop, versus) the server will ask for a map vote, the maps to vote is randomly selected between the map list, if you wish to change the quantity to show you need to recompile changing the variable MAX_VOTE_MAPS
- Most voted map of course will be selected
- If no map was voted the server will choose a random map

## Vote Kick Protection
Protects admins from being vote kicked, also when admin call a kick vote insta kicks the player without vote

To disable add ``-disableVoteKickProtection`` to command line parameters

### How it works
- The plugin listen for the call vote and check the caller and the kicker privileges

## Vote Back To Lobby Protection
Remove the back to lobby call vote, and show a message to the player saying this feature is disabled on the server, if the client has the flag ADMFLAG_CHANGEMAP ("g") he can use the vote to lobby

To disable add ``-disableBackToLobbyProtection`` to command line parameters

### How it works
- The plugin listen for the call vote and stop before working

## Ban
``!startban <userid> <"Cheating in versus mode">`` command to ban players with given userid, the ban will automatically go to the ``-banPath`` or by default: ``cfg/bans.cfg``
includes the comment saying the reason, game and ban date

The command requires the admin flag: "d"

To view userid you can use the command ``status`` in game console

### How it works
- Plugin execute the command ``banid 0 "steamid..." kick`` to ban the player, and also include that command in ``-banPath``, but you will need to exec the cfg on ``server.cfg`` -> ``exec bans.cfg``
